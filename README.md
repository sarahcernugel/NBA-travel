# Effect of Travel on Offensive Performance in the NBA

This project uses NBA game and travel data from the 2013-2022 seasons to investigate the effect of travel on offensive performance. Linear models were created with distance, rest days, and time zone shift as the predictor variables and points, field goal percentage, three point field goal percentage, free throw percentage, and assists as the response variables.
